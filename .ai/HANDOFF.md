# Handoff: Backend Foundation

## Files created/changed

- `infra/schema.sql`
- `web/lib/db.ts`
- `web/lib/bedrock.ts`
- `web/lib/memory.ts`
- `web/app/api/ingest/route.ts`
- `.ai/HANDOFF.md`

## What was verified

- `web/`: `npx tsc --noEmit` passed.
- `web/`: `npm run lint` passed.
- `infra/schema.sql` static sanity passed:
  - file starts with `SET CLUSTER SETTING feature.vector_index.enabled = true;`
  - six required tables are present
  - `memory_chunks.embedding` uses `VECTOR(1024)`
  - cosine vector index line is `CREATE VECTOR INDEX ON memory_chunks (embedding vector_cosine_ops);`
  - `deadlines` has `UNIQUE (user_id, title, due_date)`
  - `deadlines` has a `(user_id, due_date)` index

## Pending live infra

- Run `cockroach sql --url $DATABASE_URL < infra/schema.sql` against a real CockroachDB v25.x cluster and confirm all six tables plus the vector index are created.
- Run a DB smoke query through `web/lib/db.ts` once `DATABASE_URL` is configured.
- Call Titan V2 through Bedrock and confirm `embed()` returns exactly 1024 dimensions.
- Call Claude through Bedrock with representative IRCC/deadline text and confirm `extractDeadlines()` returns the expected JSON array.
- Start the Next.js app and run `curl -F file=@sample.pdf localhost:3000/api/ingest`; confirm the response includes `{ documentId, deadlines }`.
- Verify CockroachDB rows are written to `memory_documents`, `memory_chunks`, `deadlines`, and `agent_events`, with non-empty 1024-dimension embeddings.
- Repeat ingest of the same deadline and confirm `UNIQUE (user_id, title, due_date)` prevents duplicate deadline rows.
- Force Claude, Titan, S3, and DB failures with live credentials/config and confirm structured error responses.

## Key decisions and risks for Claude review

- Bedrock Claude request/response shape uses the Anthropic Messages payload for Bedrock: `anthropic_version: "bedrock-2023-05-31"`, a single user text message, and response text read from `content[].text`. This passed TypeScript only; live Bedrock model access still needs confirmation.
- Titan V2 embedding request uses `{ inputText, dimensions: 1024, normalize: true }` and validates the returned `embedding` array length. This matches the intended Titan V2 shape but still needs a live Bedrock call.
- `pdf-parse` v2 usage is `new PDFParse({ data: buffer })`, `await parser.getText()`, and `await parser.destroy()` in `finally`. This follows the v2 class API and passed TypeScript.
- Embedding concurrency is limited with a small in-process worker pool capped at 5 concurrent Titan calls. It preserves chunk order, but it does not implement retry/backoff for Bedrock throttling.
- Transaction boundaries cover CockroachDB writes only: `users` upsert, `memory_documents`, `memory_chunks`, `deadlines`, and `agent_events` are all inside one transaction. S3 upload, Claude extraction, and Titan embeddings happen before the DB transaction, so failed DB writes can leave an uploaded S3 object with no DB row.
- Deadline de-duplication uses `ON CONFLICT (user_id, title, due_date) DO UPDATE` so repeated ingest updates source metadata/confidence instead of inserting another deadline.
- Vector values are passed as pg parameters and cast with `$5::VECTOR(1024)`. This is statically type-safe from the app side, but the exact CockroachDB parameter cast behavior should be confirmed live.

## Fix round 1 (review items)

- Fix #1 document/chunk de-duplication: `memory_documents` now has `UNIQUE (user_id, text_hash)`. `writeMemory()` computes the SHA-256 text hash before Titan embedding, checks for an existing `(user_id, text_hash)` document, and reuses its `documentId` when present. Duplicate ingests skip chunk embedding and `memory_chunks` inserts, still upsert deadlines, and still write an `agent_events('ingest')` row with `deduped: true`. The insert path also uses `ON CONFLICT (user_id, text_hash) DO NOTHING` so a concurrent duplicate insert reuses the existing document instead of creating duplicate chunks.
- Fix #2 upload size limit: `/api/ingest` now enforces a named 10 MB `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` limit. It rejects oversized requests from `Content-Length` before body parsing where possible and also checks multipart files, buffered text fields, and JSON bodies after buffering as a fallback. Oversized input returns HTTP 413 with `{ error: { code: "FILE_TOO_LARGE", message } }`.
- Fix #4 pure-function tests: added `npm run test` as `vitest run`, exported `normalizeDeadline` and `parseJsonArray`, and added Vitest coverage for `chunkText`, `normalizeDeadline`, and `parseJsonArray` under `web/lib/__tests__/`. These tests do not call network, DB, S3, or Bedrock.

Verification:

- `cd web && npx tsc --noEmit`: passed, 0 TypeScript errors.
- `cd web && npm run lint`: passed, 0 ESLint errors.
- `cd web && npm run test`: passed, 2 test files and 14 tests.

Decisions/risks:

- The duplicate pre-check is intentionally outside the write transaction to avoid Titan calls for already-ingested text; all DB writes remain inside a single transaction.
- A true concurrent duplicate can still do redundant Titan work if both requests pass the pre-check before either inserts, but the unique constraint and conflict handling prevent duplicate documents/chunks from being written.

## Round 2

Files changed:

- `web/lib/bedrock.ts`
- `web/lib/memory.ts`
- `web/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- `web/app/api/deadlines/route.ts`
- `web/app/playground/page.tsx`
- `.ai/HANDOFF.md`

Static verification:

- `cd web && npx tsc --noEmit`: passed, 0 TypeScript errors.
- `cd web && npm run lint`: passed, 0 ESLint errors.
- `cd web && npm run test`: passed, 2 test files and 14 tests.

Key decisions:

- Chat context assembly combines three sections: vector-retrieved `memory_chunks`, open deadlines, and the last 10 messages in chronological order. The Claude prompt in `answer()` instructs the model to answer only from that context, use English, include exact dates when supported, and say it does not know when context is insufficient.
- Vector retrieval is raw parameterized SQL using the existing `toVectorLiteral()` helper, cosine distance with `embedding <=> $1::VECTOR(1024)`, and ascending distance order. Similarity is returned as `1 - distance`.
- `/api/chat` does Bedrock embedding, DB context retrieval, and Bedrock answer generation before opening the write transaction. The transaction covers the user upsert, user/assistant message inserts, and `agent_events('answer')` insert together.
- `/api/deadlines` uses raw parameterized SQL only. `GET` optionally filters by a validated status and orders by due date. `PATCH` validates `status` against `open|done|dismissed`, updates `status` and `updated_at`, and scopes the update to `APP_USER_ID`.
- `/playground` is a standalone `"use client"` route. It calls `/api/ingest` with `{ text }`, refreshes `/api/deadlines`, patches rows to `done`, and posts chat messages to `/api/chat`, then displays the answer and retrieved sources. It does not import or modify the teammate-owned page/layout/components.

Review notes:

- No live DB, Bedrock, S3, or HTTP calls were attempted from the sandbox.
- `web/app/page.tsx`, `web/app/layout.tsx`, and `web/components/` were not modified.
- The initial playground deadline refresh has a narrow ESLint suppression for `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`; this page is dev-only and intentionally loads backend state when opened.
